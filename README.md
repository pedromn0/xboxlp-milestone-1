## Introduction

The idea of this project is to practice the knowledge learned so far about the first modules of the Code Institue software development course.

This project was developed as a requirement of the course and is classified as the first milestone project with the discipline defined as User Centric Frontend Development.

The project itself consists of a Landing Page for the Xbox Series X, Microsoft's new video game console, focused on concentrating the main features of the console, but more than that sharing the message about the ecosystem around the console for anyone interested in buying the console.
 
## UX

The UX was idealized to connect the visual of the console, some elements of the brand but at same point feel transparency and straightforward about the key advantages and main capabilities of the ecosystem.

To help understand which elements would be interesting use to build the website some aspects regarding the strategy about the brand and console were considered as for example:
* Why are we special?
* Why would a user want this?
* Who else is doing this?
* What are the pros of what they're doing, and what are the cons?

After analyze the competitors (Nintendo and Playstation) was possible to sumarising what makes the Xbox different from those with the topics below:

- Xbox Series X is the most advanced console created in terms of processing power. 
- The Xbox deliveries an affordable game subscription which allows you to install up to 200 and this library receive contstant updates every month with new games.
- Xbox has the best backwards compatibility system to play old games with exclusive features.
- It is the only platform that allows you to play the same game in your console,PC or mobile utilising the same save. 

Embeded with those ideas the next step was create the user stories.

### External user’s goal:

- Understand what is the value proposition of buying an Xbox series X. 
- What games will be possible to play in this machine.
- How well the games is going to run and in terms of graphic and performance.
- The price and link to buy it if needed and images and videos. 

### Site owner's goal:

- Deliver a message stating the advantages of being a player on the Xbox platform. 
- Draw the attention of current users on older Xbox consoles, non gamers and users of another platforms as Nintendo or Playstation.
- The main ideia is convert them into consumers of the new Xbox product and services.

### Wireframe

In result of the analizis of the elements of the brand, product and competitors the wireframes were design with the ideia on mind to achive the main key differentials dividing the landing page in three sections and one carousel to stand out the main message.

## Testing

The tests utilised were [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [w3c Jigsaw CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

All the possible erros founded by W3C validators were corrected less those ones being part of bootstrap Frameworks.

There is only I warning regarding HTML as it is possibble to see with the screenshot:
![w3c html validator](assets/validators/w3c_html.png)

- The warning notice is a recommendation to use the h2 tag for the section in question. I use the h2 tag, but inside an article tag, so it is not being considered by the validator.

The CSS validators showed no errors:

All images were replaced with smaller sizes in an attempt to improve performance.

### Responsiveness

This project was developed to work in at least 3 different sizes Desktop, mobile and Tablet. To achive this the website has been tested on several possible devices, from 11 "or 13" inch Macs, Google Chrome developer tools, variable Android phones available to me as well as to some friends and relatives.

## Deployment

For deploy this project I utilised some of the mentioned technologies above to facilated this process.

1. The first step were created a repository on GitHub with the name **xboxlp-milestone-1**
2. Installed the **Gitpod** extension for **Google Chrome**;
3. Linked **Gitpod** gaving **access** to my **GitHub profile** with my login and password;
4. After that all repositories started to showed the **Gitpod button** just next to the button Code.
5. Clicking in the **Gitpod button** you have access to the code editor linked with this repository.
6. After editing the code it was possibble utilising **Git command** (status, add, commit and push) in the **terminal** updated Github repository.
7. To deploy was necessary went to repository settings and scrolled down untill the options Github pages **check it out here!**
8. In the link it was necessary went to option **source** and selected the main branch
9. After that I clicked on the button **save**.
